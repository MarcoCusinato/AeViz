 # AeViz #
 ## Setup and installation
 Let's start by kicking off the required packages and libraries. All we need is `Python >= 3.8` (this is required for importing the `typing` library) and the packages contained in the `requirements.txt` file. To install the required packages, run the following command:
 ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then we can install the `AeViz` package just by navigating into the `AeViz` main folder (where `setup.py` is located) and then running the following command:
```bash
    pip install .
```
This will install the `AeViz` package in your local environment.
