# AeViz

## Introduction

AeViz is a Python package meant to analyse and visualize core collapse supernova simulations from Aenus-ALCAR. It is spiritual successor of an old package (Scidata). 

## Requirements

This being a `Python` package, it requires a version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer. Besides, it makes heavy use of five `Python` libraries
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
 - [h5Py](https://www.h5py.org/)
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
 - [f90nml](https://pypi.org/project/f90nml/)

To install their latest version just run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
inside the package folder.

## Installation
To install this package just clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/MarcoCusinato/scidata.git
```
then navigate to the package folder and run install it with `pip`
```
cd scidata
pip install .
```
Congrats you have successfully installed `scidata`! <br/>
The first time you will import it, it will create a local storage folder called `Simulation_analysis_quantities`, if it does not already exist, in your home directory (Linux) or Desktop (Windows) to store some quantities that are numerically expensive to calculate.  Additionally, inside the scidata package will be created a dictionary to store the simulation path, and a symlink to the package will be added to the Desktop or home directory depending on the platform you are working on.<br/>

## Getting started

### Add search paths
First of all let's include some paths to search for simulations. Navigate to 
```
scidata/paths
```
and run `add_paths.py` with one or both of the following options:
- `--add-paths-file`, followed by one or more paths to files containing search paths
- `--add-paths`, followed by one or more search paths.
A path file can be every text file or a `.bz2` or `.gz` archive containing a text file. Moreover, it should look like a list of paths. <br/>
Let's name `foo.txt` a file with a list of path that looks like:
```
/first/path/to/search
/second/path/to/search
...
```
Then call 
```
python3 add_paths.py --add-paths-file /path/to/foo.txt
>Paths to search: [/first/path/to/search, /second/path/to/search]
>Path: /first/path/to/search
>Checking...
>   /subpath/one
>   /subpath/two
>   ...
>Added n simulations
```
This process can take from few seconds to several minutes depending on the number of simulations present in the chosen paths. <br/>
In case you are working on windows, the first time it will ask you where your Linu server is mounted. If you are working with simulations downloaded in your current machine just leave it blank. <br/>
PLEASE REMEMBER: every time you add a simulation to a folder you have to re-run the script. 

### Data Analysis 

Please before starting the data analysis bear in mind that this script will create a folder named `Simulations_analysis_quantities` in your home directory if you are working on Linux or Desktop on Windows to store some quantities that are numerically expensive to calculate.<br/>
To start the analysis, first of all, load the _main_ script of the module
```
from scidata.quantities.quantities import SimulationAnalysis
```
then load a simulation (i. e. `s20-064`)
```
sim = SimulationAnalysis('s20-064')
```
If there are two simulations with different dimension (i. e. one is 1D and the other 3D) it will ask you to specify the requested one. <br/> 
However, if you have not added any simulation path, you can supply it directly as
``` 
sim = SimulationAnalysis('sim_name', simulation_folder_path = '/path/to/sim/')
```
Now you have access to every `SimulationAnalys` method to get the most common quantities present in a simulation.
Let's try, for example, to calculate the PNS radius for all simulation timestep. To do this just run:
```
sim.get_PNS_radius()
> PNS radius file not found. Creating one with default settings.
> If different settings are needed please refer to the "PNS_radius(...)"
```
With default settings this method would not return nothing but will create a file named `PNS_radius.h5` inside the local storage folder in your home or desktop directory. <br/>
Now re-run the same method with some options enabled to get the averaged PNS radius,
```
averaged_pns_radius = sim.get_PNS_radius(PNS_radius = False, indices = False, min_max_average = True,
                                        ret_time = False, ghost_cells = False, tob_corrected = True)
```
By plotting it you will get something like [this plot]()

Similarly you can get other quantities and derive many useful stuff by using other `SimulationAnalysis` methods. Please refer to its methods description (when avaiable) to find the ones you need.

## Future developments
Probably what I will need to use at the moment :)
